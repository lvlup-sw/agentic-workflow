# Getting Started

Welcome to Agentic.Workflow! This guide walks you through building deterministic, auditable AI agent workflows in .NET. By the end, you will understand how to create workflows that are reliable, testable, and production-ready.

## What You Will Learn

- **Installation** - Add Agentic.Workflow packages to your project
- **Basic Workflows** - Create your first workflow with state and steps
- **Branching** - Route execution based on conditions
- **Parallel Execution** - Run independent tasks concurrently
- **Loops** - Iterate until quality thresholds are met
- **Approvals** - Pause workflows for human review
- **Agent Selection** - Choose the best agent for each task

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **.NET 10 SDK** or later
- **PostgreSQL 14+** for workflow persistence
- Basic familiarity with C# and async/await

## Quick Start

If you prefer to jump straight into code, here is the minimal setup:

```csharp
// 1. Install packages
// dotnet add package Agentic.Workflow
// dotnet add package Agentic.Workflow.Marten

// 2. Configure services
services.AddAgenticWorkflow()
    .AddMartenPersistence(connectionString);

// 3. Define a workflow
var workflow = Workflow<OrderState>
    .Create("process-order")
    .StartWith<ValidateOrder>()
    .Then<ProcessPayment>()
    .Finally<SendConfirmation>();

// 4. Start the workflow
await workflowStarter.StartAsync("process-order", initialState);
```
